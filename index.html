                    The UCLA Jack Benny Award was established in 1977 by the Campus Events Commission and Mary Benny, the
                    late Jack Benny's wife, in order to recognize individuals for their unique contributions to comedy.
                    Since its inception, the students of UCLA - with the approval of the Benny Estate - have presented the award
                    to some of the foremost entertainers of our time.

                        Kevin Spacey Fowler KBE (born July 26, 1959) is an American actor, film director, producer,
                        singer and comedian. He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s before obtaining
                        supporting roles in film and television. He gained critical acclaim in the early 1990s that
                        culminated in his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller
                        The Usual Suspects (1995), and an Academy Award for Best Actor for midlife crisis-themed drama
                        American Beauty (1999).

                        fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001), and the role of Lex Luthor in the superhero film

                        The recipients of the UCLA Spencer Tracy Award were selected because their body of work, in some way,
                        embodied the professional spirit of Mr. Tracy, an actor who many have considered one of the finest
                        actors in film history.

                        Over Spencer Tracy's 37-year career, he portrayed a wide variety of characters “with such
                        naturalness, such ease, that you almost forgot that you were watching a performance – he
                        simply was the man he was playing.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A critic once noted that the beauty of Tracy’s acting was that “you never saw the strings attached.”
                        His acting was, to his audience, real and true. Elizabeth Taylor once said: "His acting seemed
                        almost effortless, it seemed almost as if he wasn't
                        doing anything, and yet he was doing everything. It came so subtly out of his eyes, every muscle in
                        his face - he was a film actor."
                        <br><br>
                        Richard Widmark once commented: "It's what every actor tries to
                        strive for - to make it so simple, so real that anybody in the audience can say, 'Oh, I could do that'
                        - if you can ever achieve that kind of grace in acting you're on the way. And Tracy did it from the
                        very beginning."

                        Spencer Tracy’s acting was recognized in his lifetime with numerous awards and nominations.
                        He became the first actor to win the Academy Award for best actor for two consecutive years
                        (for 1937’s "Captains Courageous" and 1938's "Boys Town").  The next actor to achieve that
                        distinction was Tom Hanks some 55 years later – and a Spencer Tracy Award recipient.

                        To bring Spencer Tracy’s legacy to the current era, the American Film Institute has recognized
                        Mr. Tracy near the very top of its list of the “50 Greatest Screen Legends” of all time.
